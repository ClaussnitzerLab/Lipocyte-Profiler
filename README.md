# LipocyteProfiler
LipocyteProfiler is an unbiased high-throughput microscopy profiling assay that uses a combination of cellular stains, making it amenable to large-scale profiling of lipid-accumulating cell types. This repository summaries the key steps of the LipocyteProfiler pipeline described in the manuscripte. 

Discovering cellular programs of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of metabolic traits in adipocytes using LipocyteProfiler

In this manuscripte LipocyteProfiler was applied to adipocytes and hepatocytes and it was demonstrated that LipocyteProfiler is able to survey diverse cellular mechanisms by generating context-, process-, and allele-specific morphological and cellular profiles, which offer insights into metabolic disease risk mechanisms.

key steps: 

1) Generation and visualisation of polygenic-risk of metabolic diesaes specific, allele-specific LipocyteProfiles. (Figure 5, 6, 7)

3) Variance component analysis of intrinsic and extrinsic variables on LipocyteProfiles (Figure S3)
